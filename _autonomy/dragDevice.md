This project was one of my first exposures to rigorous analysis with sensors, uncertainty quantification, Lab View, and technical reporting on those things.

**Abstract:** The drag coefficient, $C_D$, of a flat disk and rectangular bar are measured
and expressed as a function of the Reynolds number, $Re$, using a custom-built
measurement device mounted in a wind tunnel. An established method for data
acquisition is applied using signal conditioning and calibration of the measurement system with known loads. Drag is then measured at different wind speeds.
It is found that the constructed measurement device is more accurate and less
sensitive to uncertainties when subjected to higher air flow velocities. Several
recommendations are made, including using a different material, using specialized measuring devices, and securing the measurement device and attached wires
securely.
