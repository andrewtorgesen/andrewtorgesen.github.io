## "Amalgamations"

The following works are re-framings and combinations, or amalgamations, of other artists' works that I thought would be fun to combine into a single coherent piece.

The piece below, which I'm calling *Svegliando*, is a combination of various frames of increasing "zoom level" from Disney's *Pinocchio*, depicting a quiet little town awakening to a new day. Having always been a fan of Tudor-style architecture and artwork depicting scenes from the European countryside, I wanted to take a crack at combining the various frames into a single, larger one. The results are below, together with a time-lapse video showing the process of combining the frames into a single static scene.
